# Mealplanner - React Native

In 2020 I participated in Nucamp's Full-Stack bootcamp. In the 3rd course, we created mobile apps with React Native. This project was my submission for the course. 

As part of the React course, I created a web app to go along with this mobile app. [View app repository here](https://github.com/madisonisfan/mealplanner-react)

## My Inspiration
For almost my entire life I've had a passion for health and fitness. Like most people, I found it difficult to find healthy foods that I enjoy and to stay consistent with healthy eating. My goal is to create a place for people to go where they can organize their weekly meal plans, and be motivated by the app community. To help with finding food options for everyone, I created a feature that allows anyone to add a recipe. With everyone adding recipes, there would be an extensive list of food. 


## Features
- Recipe Page: Here, users can view all recipes and sort the recipes by meal type (ex: Breakfast). From here, users can also choose to add a recipe to the site, and favorite recipes from the lists. 
- Mealplan Page: This page is where users can view and edit their meal plan for the week. 
- Blog: To create a community, I added a blog feature that allows users to interact with each other. People can create posts and view and comment on each other's posts. 
- Profile Page: Here users can view and edit their details, such as recipes
