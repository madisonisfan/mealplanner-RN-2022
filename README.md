# Meal Planner React Native app 

This app was built from scratch with React Native. 

For almost my entire life I've had a passion for health and fitness. Like most people, I found it difficult to find healthy foods that I enjoy and to stay consistent with healthy eating. My goal is to create a place for people to go where they can organize their weekly meal plans, and be motivated by the community integrated with the site. To help with finding food options for everyone, I created a feature that allows anyone to add a recipe to the site. With everyone adding recipes, there would be an extensive list of food.

## Features: 
- Recipes: Here, users can scroll through a list of recipes. They can filter by meal type and save recipes they enjoy
- Blog: The blog will allow users to create posts and interact with others by liking and commenting. 
- Meal Plan: Here, a user can view their weekly plan. They can add and switch meals and press a button to say they have   completed that meal. 

## Future Features
- Profile: The screen will hold more information about a user


## Technologies:
