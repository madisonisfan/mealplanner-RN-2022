# Mealplanner - React Native - 2022


In 2021 I participated in Nucamp's Full-Stack bootcamp. In the 3rd course, we created mobile apps with React Native. For the course project, I developed a Meal Planner mobile app. At the end of 2022, I began recreating this app with newer technology and improved skills. 

I recently developed a Rest API server that responds to data requests from the app. [View app repository here](https://github.com/madisonisfan/mealplanner_RN_2022_Server)

## My Inspiration
I've had a passion for health and fitness for almost my entire life. Like most people, I find it challenging to find healthy foods I enjoy and stay consistent with healthy eating. To help find food options for everyone, I created a feature allowing anyone to add a recipe. With everyone adding recipes, there would be an extensive list of food. My goal is to create a place for people to go where they can organize their weekly meal plans and be motivated by the integrated app community.

  - In the bottome right corner there is a plus button that brings users to a recipe form that allows them to add their own recipes to the app.
