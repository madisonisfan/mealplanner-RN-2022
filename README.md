# Meal Planner React Native app 

This app was built from scratch with React Native. I have always had a passion for healthy living and fitness. With improving my health, I found that meal planning was always the most challenging part. No meal planning apps fit what I was looking for, so I built one. 

The feature I am most excited about is the blog. Integrating a community into the app will encourage users to continue using the app and will help people motivate each other. 

## Features: 
- Recipes: Here, users can scroll through a list of recipes. They can filter by meal type and save recipes they enjoy
- Blog: The blog will allow users to create posts and interact with others by liking and commenting. 
- Meal Plan: Here, a user can view their weekly plan. They can add and switch meals and press a button to say they have   completed that meal. 

## Future Features
- Profile: The screen will hold more information about a user


## Technologies: 
- React Native
- React Redux
- React Navigation
- React Native Elements 
- React Native Dropdown Picker
- Font Awesome
